{"Arts Enterprises: Structures and Strategies ": {"course_no": "93703", "course_description": "Arts Enterprises: Structures and Strategies examines the fundamental structures, governance, and management systems involved in running a successful 21st century arts enterprise. The course goes beyond a principles of arts management position to introduce students to the local, national, and international forces that make running an arts-based business unique. Students discover how arts enterprises are governed internally (formal leadership) and externally (public policy, market forces, and financial realities). Furthermore, students learn how enterprises engage multiple stakeholders, from artists or politicians to staff or audiences. Almost daily, arts managers are faced with choices that affect internal operation dynamics and external stakeholder relations. During the course, students will discern the day-to-day systems and operations of well-run arts organizations and investigate moments of failure in order to find the lessons learned. The course provides a lens into the nexus of institution-artist-audience within a framework of mission-impact and ROI. This course provides students with both the fundamentals and the emerging practices within arts enterprises creating a foundation for subsequent, advanced coursework. Students will encounter the theoretical frameworks necessary to understand the enterprise, and then ground the theory in real-life experience, case studies, and course-exercises. The course is organized in 4 modules: Public Policy and the Arts, Law and Structuring a Business, Running the Enterprise, and Issues in the Field. For the purpose of this course, arts enterprises will be defined as those that create relationships between artists and audiences.

In the beginning the arts were for entertainment profit. Today, the need to entertain pay the bills persists, yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences via one or several intersecting art forms. Producing a successful season entails selection (planning) implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent. Driving complicating the situation is the usual bifurcated management structure. Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director - an individual with an aesthetic framework that shapes an institution its artistic offerings. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical financial situation of a company. Combining mixing these forces is frequently messy always an adventure. Organizational history provides some structures to the process, but each season brings new artistic managerial challenges against a backdrop of a rapidly changing society. If a career of doing the same thing is the goal then a different field might be recommended. This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure. Over 7 short weeks we will attempt to answer the following question: How do managers move an organization mission through an artistic vision set across a selection of programs create a system to manage the process evaluate artistic success, community impact mission-centric strategic goals? How can arts leaders commission new works in an environment that provides greater earned income for doing things people already know?"}, "Arts Facilities Management ": {"course_no": "93813", "course_description": "The course provides students with a comprehensive overview of the many facets involved in managing and operating a performing arts facility - in general and more specifically in Pittsburgh.

More than a large model or mere three-dimensional rendering of form, the prototype is a testbed and instrument of design projection. The prototype brings with it the physical instantiation of design ideas at larger scale and in actual materials to provide the designer with the feedback of material qualities and performance. The prototyping process is a potential vehicle for discovery in which affordances of fabrication processes and unanticipated results expand the realm of possibilities and challenge assumptions of linear design to fabrication processes. The course places great emphasis upon the reciprocity of design and prototyping, challenging students to leverage physical artifacts as tools for thinking. Prototyping is a means of exploration, not merely a method of production or fabrication. Selecting an architectural condition from a previous design project, students utilize modeling, prototyping, and simulating to develop a detailed architectural element. Students produce a series of versions of their architectural element culminating in a final prototype and collection of digital representations. The course is structured as two modules. Module 1 provides a historical and theoretical background of digital fabrication in architecture, while asking students to identify significant references related to their architectural element, its potential material makeup, construction system, and fabrication process(es). Module 2 operates as a laboratory/workshop in which students produce a comprehensive collection of models, material tests, simulations and prototypes using both digital and analog methods of fabrication."}, "IDeATe Special Topics in Animation: Story Development ": {"course_no": "60335", "course_description": "IDeATe Special Topics in Animation: Story Development provides insight and strategy for animated storytelling in film and media production.

This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions. It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature. Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic). Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making. It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis. The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. A unique feature of this course is blending market-based valuation and decision making concepts and techniques within business analytics. This course thus includes essential content for students seeking managerial and consulting careers in a wide range of industries and settings. Applications comprise, but are not limited to, energy, commodities, manufacturing, real estate, pharmaceutical, and high tech enterprises, as well as research and development projects and entrepreneurial endeavors."}, "Fixed Income ": {"course_no": "46956", "course_description": "This course introduces the most important securities traded in fixed income markets and the valuation models used to price them.

How to determine what is best is a topic which we will also discuss; we will explore the use of the Taguchi Loss Function to help answer this question. We will also consider some of the issues surrounding successful adoption of quality improvement initiatives finding ways of improving quality but being unable to get anyone to implement them is a prototypical problem in quality programs, including six sigma. We will then discuss strategies and tools which can be used to try to ensure quality; it is important to not only be familiar with the tools supporting quality design and control, but also to understand when and how they can best be correctly applied. In this area we will study three central topics the first two, sampling and control charts, serve as a basis for the correct application and evaluation of the third, design of experiments. These central topics will be illustrated through exercises, experiments, and cases, culminating in a final interactive capstone case for the class.

The intended audience for this course is those who seek better understanding of the connection between operations and strategy, including an operations manager, a general or marketing manager (who interfaces with operations), a consultant, and an entrepreneur. Operations strategy enables the execution of corporate/business strategy (i.e., how to best deliver the value proposition), and it involves configuring and developing resources processes used to design, produce, distribute, and deliver goods and/or services. Operations strategy must be aligned with other functional strategies, and therefore this course is integrative in nature, drawing upon concepts introduced in other disciplines such as strategy, marketing, finance, and organizational behavior. This course is the highest-level elective in the operations concentration, and it is also counted for the strategy concentration. Operations strategy must build on good understanding of day-to-day operations management as well as corporate/business strategy. The strategic decisions studied in this course require a detailed analysis and understanding of the underlying operations.

The way your business interacts with government can make you a success or a failure. Competitive markets are efficient only under certain assumptions. Governments differ in how (and if) they try to create an environment that meets those assumptions. During this course, you will gain an understanding of the factors that drive both businesses and the public to ask for government action, and most importantly, why these actions can vary by country. The overlap between the roles of business and those of government change over time and differ from place to place. The course will examine the cycles of business and government interaction, and evaluate the inputs and outcomes. For example, why does a meeting with an agency head seldom change regulations? What really influences regulatory agencies? Examples will demonstrate how business and governments interact to positively structure complicated problems and become partners for the benefit of all participants.

It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic). Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision-making.

With cryptosystems, hospitals can collaboratively train a machine learning model to predict outbreaks without sharing sensitive patient data in the clear; organizations can outsource and compute directly on encrypted data in the public cloud; and users can search a website without revealing their queries. In this course, we will explore how to build such cryptosystems from two aspects: theoretic concepts and practical systems building. We will learn beautiful cryptographic concepts (e.g., homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proof, oblivious computation) and how systems make use of such techniques in practice (e.g., in encrypted databases, federated and collaborative machine learning learning, blockchains). Throughout the course, we will think about how cryptographic concepts can help protect existing applications and enable new applications, and how systems techniques can make advanced cryptography more efficient, scalabe, and usable.

On the other hand, one often has many choices: One fast disk, or two slow ones? More memory, or a faster processor? A fair scheduler or one that minimizes mean response time? For multi-server systems, one can choose from a wide array of load balancing policies, a wide array of migration policies, capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies ... The possibilities are endless. The best choices are often counter-intuitive. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions before investing the time and money to build a system.

This workshop builds upon a thesis that interactive games share a large portion of dramatic theory DNA with plays, TV and film. gameplay is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. To do so, we first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both system as well as narrative best practices. Once we lay the groundwork, each writer uses an existing pen-and-paper RPG system as well as a pre-existing world to create a campaign-style story for that system and that story world. The final product is a portfolio-quality set of dramatic scenes, epic tabletop encounters, and character sketches. This is mainly a writing course, not an RPG design course. Any level of writing experience is welcome, BUT experience playing RPGs -- eother tabletop or video game -- is a must. How RPGs work will not be taught. This CAN be learned, of course -- its not hard -- but that learning will take place in addition to class hours either in person locally or on line. .

That toolkit will include methods for the collection data, its processing via off-the-shelf software and some simple code, as well as its analysis using a variety of statistical techniques. In doing so, the class offers students in the humanities the opportunity to put their expertise in qualitative analysis into conversation with more quantitative approaches, and those from more technically-oriented fields the opportunity to gain experience with the possibilities and pitfalls of working with language. The first part of the term will be devoted to introducing fundamental concepts and taking a birds eye view of their potential application in domains like academic writing, technical communication, and social media. From there, students will initiate projects of their own choosing and develop them over the course of the semester. The goal is to acquaint students with the strengths and limitations of computer-aided textual analysis and to provide them with the necessary foundational skills to design projects, to apply appropriate quantitative methods, and to report their results clearly and ethically to a variety of audiences.

It moves from the silent cinema of the 1910s to the Weimar Republic, when German cinema represented Hollywoods greatest challenger in the international cinema world. It then addresses the cinema of Hitlers so-called Third Reich, when German cinema dominated European movie theaters, and moves on to the cinema of divided Germany from 1949-1989, when cinema in the socialist east and cinema in the capitalist west developed in very different ways. In the final week of the semester, the course will address German cinema in the post-unification period, which has experienced a revival in popularity and interest. The two historical foci of the semester will be the Weimar Republic, the classic era of German cinema, and the era of the so-called New German Cinema of the 1970s and 1980s, when major German directors developed radical new approaches to cinema and critiques of Hollywood. Among the great directors focused on in the course of the semester will be Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, Fritz Lang, Leni Riefenstahl, Wolfgang Staudte, Werner Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

Sometimes these phenomena spark our imagination and affirm our confidence in a better future. In other instances, they create fear and generate protests over the risks new technologies and scientific ideas pose to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. In this course we will examine the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end we will engages with questions such as: How do we decide who an expert is? To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work? Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas? We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring public debates including conflicts over global warming, vaccinations, and the AIDS crisis. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology, and the public. We will also look to these fields for tools to assess public debate and to complicate and/or affirm prevailing theories about the relationship between science and society."}, "Revenge Tragedy ": {"course_no": "76446", "course_description": "Attendants to the early modern English theater seem to have had an almost insatiable appetite for revenge tragedy: a lurid, blood-soaked genre distinguished by plots involving insanity, skulls, ghosts, poisonings, stabbings, suicide, and other forms of unnatural death.

I am suggesting you keep a writing notebook - for this class but I will not require it as everyones writing process is different. One of the great differences between fiction writing at the introductory or intermediate level and fiction at the advanced level is the writers ability to discuss their own work, and the work of others, in interesting and original ways.

Many companies and Governmental agencies ask and try to answer questions of this type every day. Moreover, they are now also actively seeking tools that can take advantage of big datasets to answer these questions as well as skillful individuals that know how to use them confidently. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild.

In this course, we will be looking at questions from several of these areas of philosophy, including: What is the mind? Do we have free will? What does the answer to that question mean for practices of reward and punishment? Is morality relative? What, if anything, is its connection to religion? How can I know the right thing to do? How can I know anything?

Morally speaking, what (if anything) is the difference between killing someone, and simply letting them die? In trying to answer these questions (and others), well engage in some wonderfully weird thought experiments, class discussions, smaller group discussions, debates, etc. Well study and critique several moral theories which try to explain and help guide our moral judgments, and well try to apply these theories to real-life moral controversies.

This is an introductory philosophy class, so youll be learning how to read, critique, do, and write philosophy generally, not just ethics.

Sub-areas of linguistics which we study include phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the study of sound systems), morphology (the study of parts of words), and syntax (the study of combinations of words). Furthermore, we highlight various respects in which language and linguistics intersects with societal issues.

For example, while fundamental values such as tradition, purity, equality, and inclusiveness are widely held across the political spectrum, conservatives are theorized to prioritize tradition and purity while liberals are theorized to prioritize equality and inclusiveness. This can lead to ineffective political communication, as conservatives attempt to persuade through purity and tradition based arguments which are not as persuasive to liberals, while liberals attempt to persuade through equality and inclusiveness arguments which are not as persuasive to conservatives. This can lead to polarization, as each side feels the other is ignoring important values in the debate. For this project, we are seeking assistance in developing arguments for and against specific issues, based in the logic of different fundamental values. (e.g. tradition based appeals in favor of stricter immigration laws, tradition based appeals in favor of looser immigration laws, equality based appeals in favor of stricter immigration laws, and equality based appeals in favor of looser immigration laws).

There, we have collaborative reviews, substantive discussions and critical reflections. The central question of the course is this: How can we analyze the structure of rational discourse or, more specifically, the logical structure of argumentation? An answer to this question requires: (i) uncovering the logical form of statements; (ii) defining the correctness of logical steps; (iii) formulating inference rules for the logical forms; (iv) designing strategies for argumentation with the inference rules.

This course will explore Ramseys seminal contributions to probability and decision theory, philosophical and mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. We will read some of Ramseys original papers as well as more recent work inspired in response to, or as an elaboration on, Ramseys views. We will see how Ramsey laid the foundations of the theory of subjective probability and decision theory, offered one of the first formulations of a deflationary theory of truth, and inspired contemporary work in philosophical logic (particularly on the logic of conditionals). We will explore Ramseys influential work in the philosophy of science - his accounts of laws, causality, and the nature of scientific theories - as well as his mathematical contributions to logic and (what is now known as) Ramsey theory.

In addition, semantics faces the conceptual challenge of saying what meaning is. This course will reflect the history of semantics within linguistic theory and examine solutions to the problem of the definition of meaning. The course begins with the meanings of words and examines how these meanings combine to give the meanings of sentences, based on the notion of truth conditions for indicative sentences. That notion of meaning is then extended to sentences in other moods, and to sentences that do not simply describe how the world is, including sentences which are modal, conditional, or simply fictional.

On the other hand, from the outside we get a much richer theory of semantics allowing us to prove properties of intuitionistic theories that can never hold when we assume excluded middle. Topological models and realizability models can be used to establish many surprising independence and consistency results, such as the consistency of Brouwers principle, which states all functions are continuous, and Churchs thesis, which states all functions are computable. Other models such as Kleene slash and q-realizability can be used to extract computational information from proofs and show that certain theories in intuitionistic logic have existence properties allowing us to find explicit witnesses from mere proofs of existence.

The SDGs reflect an optimists perspective regarding international development. Optimists highlight the tremendous progress in improving the quality of human life that has been made during the past 200 years, and in particular since the end of World War II. Building on this record, achieving the SDGs will mark a notable step forward in addressing the most serious inequities that exist across the globe, including extreme poverty, food insecurity, illiteracy, and inadequate health care. SDGs aside, pessimists worry about the enormous challenges currently confronting the international community. They note that by 2050 global population will reach 9.6 billion people. To feed an increasingly affluent number of people, we will need 70 percent more food production and a doubling of available water and arable land, which will come at the expense of existing natural systems. The availability of these essential inputs is further complicated by the reality that the planet is undergoing vast biological and physical changes due to climate change and environmental degradation. Human communities are changing as well. More than 50 percent of the worlds population live in urban areas and 75 percent of the worlds largest cities will be found in the developing world over the next few decades.

This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights. The very first (and arguably considered at the time as the most essential) of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the free speech amendment to the Constitution. This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms: freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances.
